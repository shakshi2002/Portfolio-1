               The transition from sixth form, or college, to your new place of study can seem daunting. I’ve been in your shoes; I’ve taken my GCSEs, my A-Levels and have now graduated from university. After lugging everything I owned halfway across the country, I arrived at university a complete rookie. I’d done zero research and felt like ‘Where’s Wally?’ in the middle of a very wild safari park. I was the very definition of a fresher. It was loud, it was busy, and it felt somewhat overwhelming

            <h3>University life </h3>
            <span class="education-date">May2019 - May2023</span>
            <h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   <h3> It’s not just about getting a degree!</h3>

<p>Going to university isn’t just about studying – but you have to learn to balance your work-life ratio. You’ll have time to study, and time to take up other activities. Every university will have sports teams and societies that you can get involved with. Some universities offer volunteering opportunities for students. Campus universities have job opportunities in bars, shops and food outlets. Other opportunities may include getting a job as an assistant researcher, where you support your lecturers in their research. You can also get paid to take part in studies at university – and it can feel good to help final year students by taking part in their dissertation research. Every university has a Students’ Union, and that’s where your voice comes in: every student voice matters, and your feedback can have a hugely positive impact on your university.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <h3>You’ll stay in touch with your friends and family!</h3>

<p>If you’ve decided to move away for university, whatever the distance , you’ll still have time to keep in touch with the people you care about. One of my housemates at university kept in such close contact with his parents that, despite them living more than 50 miles away, they still washed and dried his clothes every other week. What I’m trying to say is, don’t worry about losing contact with your loved ones – you’ll always find the time for a catch-up.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <h3>You’re in charge!</h3>

<p>The first point I’d like to make is that you’re in charge of your degree. Outside of your scheduled lectures and seminars, you’re the one who decides whether to carry on studying or whether to spend the rest of your day relaxing. Every decision made is your own; you fuel your own desires, your own dreams, your own future. Yes, you have the support of academic staff, friends and family, but you make the ultimate decisions. So, you have to organise your free time accordingly, especially if you’re a social butterfly like myself. Are you going to be the student who starts their assignment weeks in advance, or the student who pulls an all-nighter before a 10am deadline.</p>
